// Package adjudicate declares the context-maintenance tool the cold-sweep adjudication asks with, and
// the wire helpers that keep it byte-stable in the prompt-cache prefix.
//
// WHY A TOOL AT ALL, rather than only asking for a JSON array in the reply text. The ask carries the
// AGENT's tools, because `tools` are in the cache key and stripping them costs the read — so the only
// question is what the model does with that freedom. Three arms, same transcript and ask model, three
// benchmark passes each, run sequentially:
//
//	tool_choice          verdict tool   asks replied   unusable       answered via tool_use
//	{"type":"none"}      no             20             6  (30.0%)     0
//	(omitted)            NO             24             14 (58.3%)     0
//	(omitted)            yes            77             7  (9.1%)      43 (55.8%)
//
// Fisher two-tailed: row 1 vs row 3 p = 0.0245, row 2 vs row 3 p = 0.0000.
//
// The MIDDLE row is why this package exists, and it is the arm nobody had run: removing
// tool_choice:none on its own is WORSE than leaving it in. Freed to call a tool and offered only the
// agent's own plus context_guru_expand, the model calls one of those; logging every reply's content
// blocks caught it as `thinking,tool_use:context_guru_expand` with no text block at all, which the
// text-only extraction reads as "" and files as unusable. That arm also lost 5 asks to the 90 s
// llmCallTimeout against 0 and 1 in the others.
//
// So the two halves are one change. Suppressing the call trades a lost answer for prose (row 1's
// failures); allowing it with nothing worth calling loses the answer outright (row 2); allowing it and
// declaring the right tool gets 55.8% of replies back schema-shaped at cache-read price, with the rest
// still read by the unchanged prose parser (row 3).
//
// FORCING the tool by name is separately not free: it produced a second cache entry (8,378 written
// against the 8,268 already cached), so tool_choice DOES participate in the key when it names a tool,
// even though `none` does not.
//
// WHERE IT IS INJECTED. On every request of an Anthropic route whose pipeline contains
// extract_llm_sweep, and nowhere else. Every-request matters because `tools` hashes before system and
// messages, so a tool that appears when the sweep fires and vanishes on the next turn invalidates the
// prefix from position zero -- the flap expand's `always` mode exists to prevent. But that argument
// only forbids gating on something that varies PER TURN: pipeline membership is fixed at config load
// and the provider by the route, so both conditions are byte-stable for a session. Injecting without
// them cost a measured 946 bytes at the head of the cacheable prefix of every preset including `off`,
// the control arm of every published comparison here, and including presets with no sweep at all.
//
// This does not replace the text path. extract.ParseVerdicts and extract.BuildFallbackAsk are still
// the fallback, and a model that answers in prose anyway is still read exactly as before; the tool
// only changes which reply shape is PREFERRED.
